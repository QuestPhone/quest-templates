Which ones are hurting?\n* What’s one thing I *know* I should do but keep putting off?\n* If today repeats forever, what kind of life will I end up with?\n* What would my ideal day look like — realistically?\n* What thoughts have been holding me back?\n* What do I want my future self to thank me for?\n* What did I learn today — about myself or the world?\n* Who or what made me feel something strong today?\n* What am I grateful for — no matter how small?\n* What would I say to myself if I were my best friend?\n* What’s something I need to let go of?\n* What’s something I need to chase harder?\n* What am I pretending not to know?\n* What does success mean to *me* — not what others say?\n\n",
