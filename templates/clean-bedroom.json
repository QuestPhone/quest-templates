So here’s what you’re doing:\n\n### 🧹 What to Do:\n\n* **Pick up every item** that’s on the floor or out of place — *nothing belongs on the ground except furniture and your feet*.\n* **Make your bed.** Crisp sheets, no wrinkles. Instant mental reset.\n* **Clear all surfaces** — desk, shelves, bedside. Wipe them down. Dust is the enemy of good energy.\n* **Put everything where it belongs.** If it doesn’t have a place, make one or toss it.\n* **Open your windows.** Air out the stale thoughts and stagnant vibes.\n* **Empty the trash** — physical and mental clutter, gone.\n* **Vacuum or sweep**. Feel the floor. Own the space.\n\n### ✅ End Goal:\n\n> A clean bedroom with **everything organized**, **everything in its place**, and **nothing in your way**.\n> You walk in, and it feels like *clarity*. Like *you’re in charge again*.\n\n",
