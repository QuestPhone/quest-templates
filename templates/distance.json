When you walk, you're not just moving your legs, you're moving your life forward. Here's how you do it:\n\n### 🚶‍♂️ What to Do:\n\n* **Start with your goal.** Today's target is #{initialHealthGoal} meters — and that number will rise with every win.\n* **Break it into chunks.** Morning walk, post-lunch stroll, evening loop. No pressure to do it all at once.\n* **Stay consistent.** Even if it rains or you're tired, show up. Every meter counts.\n* **Stretch before and after.** Loosen up your joints, protect your engine.\n* **Breathe deep as you walk.** In through the nose, out through the mouth. Let your thoughts settle.\n* **Use walking to reflect.** Think. Plan. Or just wander. This is your moving meditation.\n\n### ✅ End Goal:\n\n> A stronger body, a clearer mind, and a habit that pushes you forward.\n> With every meter, you’re building discipline, endurance, and momentum.\n> You’re not just walking — *you’re leveling up*.",
