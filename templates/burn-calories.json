Here's how to do it:\n\n### ðŸ”¥ What to Do:\n\n* **Start with your target.** Today's goal is #{initialHealthGoal} calories â€” and it will rise as you conquer each level.\n* **Mix it up.** Walk, run, dance, lift, cycle, or climb. Whatever gets your body moving and your heart pumping.\n* **Break it down.** Spread it out across the day â€” a few bursts of energy can still meet the goal.\n* **Stay consistent.** Even on lazy days, show up. Small burns lead to big changes.\n* **Fuel smart.** Eat clean, hydrate, and let your body recover strong.\n* **Feel the fire.** Every drop of sweat is a badge of momentum.\n\n### âœ… End Goal:\n\n> A body that moves with power and a mindset that refuses to quit.\n> With each calorie burned, you're proving something: *you're unstoppable*.",
